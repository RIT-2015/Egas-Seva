<br><div align="justify"><font size="4" color="blue">Textile Industry:<br></font>

Has it ever occurred to you that to produce the textiles you're wearing, LPG plays a significant role?  The four main steps in the production of textile fabric:
<br>>
	
Preparation of fabric
<br>>
	
Spinning
<br>>
	
Weaving
<br>>
	
Finishing which includes Singeing, Bleaching, Dyeing, Printing, Calendering etc.
	
Each of these processes requires a heating source. Steam though mostly used is not hot enough for certain operations so LPG or electricity is usually needed in the Finishing process. LPG is better because the heat is more concentrated. The reflectors do not have to be polished and heaters do not burn out.
