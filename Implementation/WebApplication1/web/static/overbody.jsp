LPG as a household cooking fuel was introduced by erstwhile Burmah Shell under the brand name ?Burshane? in mid 1955.  Since then till today LPG industry has grown tremendously.<br>
E-gas sewa offers you a user-friendly interface to make LPG registration , booking a easy process. Along with this E-gas gives you up to date information about various products available<br>

 
<b><br>Achievements</b><br>
Market research helped in understanding the strength of the brand and out lining the way forward. One of the major changes was to create a Strategic Business Unit to deal with E-gas.  Soon programmes totally focused on meeting customers? need were drawn up. <br> 

A pioneer in more ways than one, E-gas has brought many innovative offerings to the customers?. <br>
The Corporation was quick to realize the need to look at the needs of the ?Urban? and the ?Rural? customer differently. <br> 
	
Over the years, the urban Market reach was very large, the customer more sensitive.  Whereas, it was a herculean task to reach the rural consumers primarily due to inhabitation being spread over very far flung areas unlike the congested urban areas, thereby creating a logistic challenge.  Having understood the needs of the two different segments, E-gas undertook various initiatives. <br>

 
<b><br>Urban</b><br>
Customer initiatives included launch of an exclusive website www.ee-gas.com to provide convenience of booking E-gas ?On Line? to customers. The website also provides a feed back system enabling the consumers to directly speak to the Organisation.  Other methods of booking through IVR systems and drop boxes placed at busy locations in town were also introduced. Booking of E-gas is also made available through SMS facility. <br>
 
<b><br>Rural</b><br>
Areas are serviced by the E-gas Rural Marketing Vehicles (RMV), comprising of tank truck and the mobile filling unit.  These RMVs service rural areas, where the traditional distributorship network was not present.  The RMVs instill great customer confidence as they can see their cylinders being filled in their presence and checked for safety. <br>
 	 
	The promise of reaching a sound cylinder with the right Q&Q is indeed fulfilled! <br>
Rural marketing having gathered momentum in India had many MNCs set up rural infrastructure to reach their own product.  E-gas has leveraged the opportunity to utilize their infrastructure to reach LPG to deep interior rural areas. <br>


 
<b><br>Industrial</b><br>
Customers too have been our focus. E-gas has demonstrated the various applications of the wonder fuel LPG for innovative uses in various Industries. <br>

E-gas has also introduced various pack sizes to suit the different types of customers. <br>
	


	Piped LPG<br>
is another first from E-gas. <br>
Well accepted by major Realty Developers, E-gas piped LPG system for multi-storied apartments and shopping malls is gaining popularity. <br>


 
Value ? Added Service <br>
This was in recognition of the need to provide the housewife relief from mundane chores of household shopping for low involvement products; the <b>?Beyond LPG?</b> initiative was launched to provide value to the customers. <br>

This involved the Organisation entering into corporate tie-ups with reputed brands and making available through the distributorship network FMCG as well as home appliances and kitchenware at attractive discounts - all home delivered to the consumers. <br>
	 
The initiative soon gathered momentum and became a successful business model providing value not only to the consumers but the network as well as the Partner Companies.  For Bharat Petroleum it was another successful business venture within 5 years with the involvement of over 25% of the distributors? voluntarily participating in the business and setting up ?E-gas Shoppes? with attractive display of product creating a comfortable shopping environment ? a far cry from the typical showroom of an LPG distributor. <br>

 
<b>Metal Cutting Gas (MCG)</b> <br>
an innovative product is the result of continuous research. An efficient and cost effective substitute for Acetylene, it is indeed a revolutionary product for the cutting and brazing industry.  <br>

The success of the product is not limited to the Indian shores but has traveled to countries in the middle-east as well as Africa. <br>
	

 
	<b>Leveraging Technology</b><br>
Harnessing technology has always been on the forefront for maximizing efficiency and achieving greater customer satisfaction. <br>

An<b> exclusive website</b> www.e-gas.com providing the convenience of booking E-gas ?On Line? alongwith information about the product, its uses, safety and conservation tips as well as <b>huge collection of recipes</b> is a popular site for women. <br>


 
The website also provides a<b> feed back system</b> enabling the consumers to directly speak to the Organisation. Booking of E-gas has also been made available through<b> SMS facility. </b><br>



 
<b><br>Environment & Society</b><br>
The brand just does not limit itself to product and services, it reaches out to belong and be part of the social fabric engaging in life giving and enhancing the quality of life of the less fortunate. <br>

E-gas employees as well as the network are engaged in various activities such as helping victims of the natural calamities or acts of insurgence and terrorism. <br>
